# EDIBO_1-Bubble-Sort

Bubble sort algorithm - take two elements of list if first element is larger than second one - swap first element. Repeat algorithm with a Loop until all elements are in ascending order.

EdvÄ«ns_EDIBO1.ipynb is created using Google Colaboratory for practice in bubble sorting. There is some diferent versions of code, that I've tried to use.
